# Zoph_RNN
This is Barret Zoph's Neural Network Machine Translation and Language Modeling toolkit.

-This code allows for multi-GPU parallelization of LSTM machine translation and language models. 

-The parallelization scheme is similar to that used in the Google implementation in the paper: Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks (Link: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf)


-For usage and instructions checkout out the tutorial.pdf
